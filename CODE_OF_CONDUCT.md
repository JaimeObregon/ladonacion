# Code of conduct

> Go placidly amid the noise and haste,\
> and remember what peace there may be in silence.\
> As far as possible, without surrender,\
> be on good terms with all persons.\
> Speak your truth quietly and clearly;\
> and listen to others,\
> even to the dull and ignorant;\
> they too have their story.\
> Avoid loud and aggressive persons;\
> they are vexations to the spirit.\
> If you compare yourself with others,\
> you may become vain or bitter,\
> for always there will be greater\
> and lesser persons than yourself.\
> Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.\
> Keep interested in your own career, however humble,\
> it's a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.\
> Exercise caution in your business affairs,\
> for the world is full of trickery.\
> But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;\
> many persons strive for high ideals,\
> and everywhere life is full of heroism .\
> Be yourself.\
> Especially do not feign affection.\
> Neither be cynical about love;\
> for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment,\
> it is as perennial as the grass.\
> Take kindly the counsel of the years,\
> gracefully surrendering the things of youth.\
> Nurture strength of spirit\
> to shield you in sudden misfortune.\
> But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.\
> Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.\
> Beyond a wholesome discipline,\
> be gentle with yourself.\
> You are a child of the universe\
> no less than the trees and the stars;\
> you have a right to be here.\
> And whether or not it is clear to you,\
> no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.\
> Therefore be at peace with God,\
> whatever you conceive him to be.\
> And whatever your labors and aspirations,\
> in the noisy confusion of life,\
> keep peace in your soul.\
> With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams,\
> it is still a beautiful world.\
> Be cheerful.\
> Strive to be happy.
